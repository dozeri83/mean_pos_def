# Fréchet (Karcher) mean algorithm
Python implementation of Fréchet mean algorithm on the space of Positive definite matrices

Based on the algorithm that presented in the paper:
"Computing the Karcher mean of symmetric positive definite matrices". Binni & Lannazzo 2013


To install and run tests:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate frechet_mean
$ pytest 

```
